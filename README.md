# CalculatorInterfaceWorkout

This project is a Java application created on Eclipse that demonstrates the implementation of an interface for basic mathematical operations. It includes an interface for performing addition and classes that implement the interface to carry out addition operations.

## Usage

This application showcases the usage of the `RechnenInterface` for addition. The `Werte` class implements the interface to perform addition on two numbers and displays the result.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run the `RechnenTest` class to see the output of the addition operation.

## Classes

### RechnenInterface

An interface that defines the `add` method for performing addition.

### RechnenTest

A class containing the main method that demonstrates the usage of the `Werte` class for performing addition.

### Werte

A class that implements the `RechnenInterface` and performs addition on two numbers. It takes two numbers as input, adds them, and displays the result.
